Fine-Grained Scoring Scaffold
=============================

- Goal: demonstrate clause/phrase-level scoring using the orchestrator in `selfcheckgpt/orchestrator.py`.
- Agents should add a runnable script/notebook here once decomposition + aggregation logic is implemented.
- Keep defaults CPU-only and reuse existing scorers; avoid modifying scorer internals unless necessary.
